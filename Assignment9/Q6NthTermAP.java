/*
 Q6- Given first term (a), common difference (d) and a integer N of the Arithmetic Progression series, 
 the task is to find Nth term of the series.

**Example 1:**

Input : a = 2 d = 1 N = 5
Output : 6
The 5th term of the series is : 6

**Example 2:**

Input : a = 5 d = 2 N = 10
Output : 23
The 10th term of the series is : 23
